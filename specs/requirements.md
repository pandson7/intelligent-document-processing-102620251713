# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for an Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) application that provides automated document analysis capabilities through a web-based interface. The system will process uploaded documents through OCR, classification, and summarization tasks, storing results in a database and displaying them to users.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Upload Interface
**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload documents through a web interface, so that I can process them automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user accesses the web application THE SYSTEM SHALL display a document upload interface
2. WHEN a user selects a document file THE SYSTEM SHALL validate the file format (JPEG, PNG, PDF)
3. WHEN a user uploads a valid document THE SYSTEM SHALL store it in AWS S3
4. WHEN a user uploads an invalid file format THE SYSTEM SHALL display an error message
5. WHEN a document upload is successful THE SYSTEM SHALL trigger the IDP processing pipeline

### Requirement 2: OCR Processing
**User Story:** As a user, I want my uploaded documents to be processed with OCR, so that I can extract text and key-value pairs from images and PDFs.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a document is uploaded THE SYSTEM SHALL extract text content using OCR
2. WHEN OCR processing is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL format results as key-value pairs in JSON format
3. WHEN OCR encounters markdown-wrapped JSON THE SYSTEM SHALL handle it correctly
4. WHEN OCR processing fails THE SYSTEM SHALL log the error and notify the user
5. WHEN OCR results are generated THE SYSTEM SHALL store them in DynamoDB

### Requirement 3: Document Classification
**User Story:** As a user, I want my documents to be automatically classified, so that I can organize them by category.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN OCR processing is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL classify the document into predefined categories
2. WHEN classification runs THE SYSTEM SHALL use these categories: Dietary Supplement, Stationery, Kitchen Supplies, Medicine, Driver License, Invoice, W2, Other
3. WHEN classification is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL assign the most appropriate category
4. WHEN classification cannot determine a category THE SYSTEM SHALL assign "Other"
5. WHEN classification results are generated THE SYSTEM SHALL store them in DynamoDB

### Requirement 4: Document Summarization
**User Story:** As a user, I want my documents to be automatically summarized, so that I can quickly understand their content.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN document classification is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL generate a concise summary
2. WHEN summarization runs THE SYSTEM SHALL create a summary based on extracted text content
3. WHEN summarization is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL produce a readable summary
4. WHEN summarization fails THE SYSTEM SHALL log the error and provide a default message
5. WHEN summarization results are generated THE SYSTEM SHALL store them in DynamoDB

### Requirement 5: Results Display
**User Story:** As a user, I want to view all processing results in the web interface, so that I can see the extracted data, classification, and summary.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN all processing tasks are complete THE SYSTEM SHALL display results in the web interface
2. WHEN displaying results THE SYSTEM SHALL show OCR key-value pairs, document category, and summary
3. WHEN a user refreshes the page THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain the displayed results
4. WHEN processing is in progress THE SYSTEM SHALL show a loading indicator
5. WHEN processing fails THE SYSTEM SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 6: Data Persistence
**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all processing results to be stored persistently, so that data is not lost and can be retrieved later.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN OCR processing completes THE SYSTEM SHALL store results in DynamoDB
2. WHEN classification completes THE SYSTEM SHALL store category results in DynamoDB
3. WHEN summarization completes THE SYSTEM SHALL store summary results in DynamoDB
4. WHEN storing data THE SYSTEM SHALL include document metadata and timestamps
5. WHEN retrieving data THE SYSTEM SHALL return complete processing results

### Requirement 7: File Format Support
**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload different types of documents, so that I can process various file formats.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a user uploads a JPEG file THE SYSTEM SHALL process it successfully
2. WHEN a user uploads a PNG file THE SYSTEM SHALL process it successfully
3. WHEN a user uploads a PDF file THE SYSTEM SHALL process it successfully
4. WHEN a user uploads an unsupported format THE SYSTEM SHALL reject it with an error message
5. WHEN processing any supported format THE SYSTEM SHALL complete all three pipeline tasks

### Requirement 8: Error Handling
**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback when errors occur, so that I understand what went wrong and can take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN any processing step fails THE SYSTEM SHALL log detailed error information
2. WHEN an error occurs THE SYSTEM SHALL display a user-friendly error message
3. WHEN network issues occur THE SYSTEM SHALL handle them gracefully
4. WHEN file upload fails THE SYSTEM SHALL provide specific error details
5. WHEN processing times out THE SYSTEM SHALL notify the user and allow retry
