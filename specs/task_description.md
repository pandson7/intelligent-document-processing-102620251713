# Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) Application - Specification Task

## Project Overview
Build an Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) application with the following requirements:

## Core Requirements
1. **Simple User Interface**: Provide a web-based interface for document upload
2. **Document Storage**: Store uploaded documents in AWS storage (S3)
3. **IDP Pipeline**: Trigger automated processing pipeline upon document upload

## IDP Pipeline Tasks (Sequential Order)
1. **OCR Processing**: Extract document contents as key-value pairs in JSON format
   - Support file formats: JPEG, PNG, PDF
   - Handle markdown-wrapped JSON correctly
   
2. **Document Classification**: Categorize documents into predefined categories
   - Available categories: Dietary Supplement, Stationery, Kitchen Supplies, Medicine, Driver License, Invoice, W2, Other
   
3. **Document Summarization**: Generate concise summaries of document content

## Data Storage & Display
- Store results of each processing task in DynamoDB
- Display all results in the user interface once processing is complete
- Ensure end-to-end functionality from upload to result display

## Testing Requirements
- Use sample documents from "~/ea_sample_docs/idp_docs" folder
- Test complete workflow: file upload → data extraction → classification → summarization
- Verify functionality with JPEG, PDF, and PNG formats
- Ensure frontend-backend integration works correctly

## Deliverables Required
1. **requirements.md**: Detailed functional and technical requirements
2. **design.md**: Technical architecture and AWS service design
3. **tasks.md**: Breakdown of implementation tasks

## Success Criteria
- End-to-end testing successful with all supported file formats
- Development server running with accessible web application
- All three IDP pipeline tasks working correctly
- Results properly stored and displayed in frontend
