# Development Task - Intelligent Document Processing Application

## Task Overview
Build a complete AWS solution for Intelligent Document Processing using CDK for infrastructure and React for frontend.

## Original User Requirements
Build Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) application. Provide a simple user interface for uploading the documents. Once the document is uploaded, store it in AWS storage and trigger IDP pipeline. IDP pipeline needs to perform these 3 tasks in the order specified here - 1. Run OCR to extract the contents as key-value pair in JSON format (handle markdown-wrapped JSON correctly). It should support JPEG, PNG and PDF file formats. 2. Document Classification (Available categories - Dietary Supplement, Stationery, Kitchen Supplies, Medicine, Driver License, Invoice, W2, Other). 3. Document Summarization. Store the results of each task in the DynamoDB and also display the results in the user interface once all 3 tasks are complete. Keep the User interface simple. Ensure it works end to end, test frontend actions with backend processing and display the results in the frontend. The sample documents are available in "~/ea_sample_docs/idp_docs" folder, use these documents to perform end to end test starting with - 1.file upload from the frontend, 2.Data Extraction in JSON format, 3.Classification, 4.summarization. Make sure file upload from frontend, data extraction, Classification and Summarization are working correctly with JPEG, PDF and PNG file formats available in sample documents provided at "~/ea_sample_docs/idp_docs". Once done, Start the development server and launch the webapp.
