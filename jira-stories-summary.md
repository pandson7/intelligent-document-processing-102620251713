### 4. EA-673: Document Summarization Engine
- **Priority:** Medium | **Story Points:** 8  
- **User Story:** As a user, I want my documents to be automatically summarized, so that I can quickly understand their content.
- **Key Features:** Amazon Bedrock with Claude 3 Sonnet, concise 2-3 sentence summaries
- **Dependencies:** Requires EA-672 (Classification)

### 5. EA-674: Results Display Interface
- **Priority:** High | **Story Points:** 5
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to view all processing results in the web interface, so that I can see the extracted data, classification, and summary.
- **Key Features:** React results components, loading states, error handling
- **Dependencies:** Requires EA-671, EA-672, EA-673 for complete results

### 6. EA-675: Data Persistence Layer
- **Priority:** High | **Story Points:** 5
- **User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all processing results to be stored persistently, so that data is not lost and can be retrieved later.
- **Key Features:** DynamoDB table design, streams, encryption, metadata tracking
- **Dependencies:** Required by all processing stories

### 7. EA-676: Multi-Format File Support
- **Priority:** Medium | **Story Points:** 3
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to upload different types of documents, so that I can process various file formats.
- **Key Features:** JPEG/PNG/PDF support, format validation, multi-page handling
- **Dependencies:** Integrates with EA-670 and EA-671

### 8. EA-677: Error Handling and User Feedback
- **Priority:** Medium | **Story Points:** 5
- **User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear feedback when errors occur, so that I understand what went wrong and can take appropriate action.
- **Key Features:** CloudWatch logging, retry logic, user-friendly error messages
- **Dependencies:** Cross-cutting concern for all stories

## Story Prioritization

### High Priority (Must Have)
1. **EA-670: Document Upload Interface** - Entry point for the system
2. **EA-671: OCR Processing Pipeline** - Core functionality for text extraction  
3. **EA-674: Results Display Interface** - Essential for user interaction
4. **EA-675: Data Persistence Layer** - Critical for data integrity

### Medium Priority (Should Have)
5. **EA-672: Document Classification System** - Adds organizational value
6. **EA-673: Document Summarization Engine** - Enhances user experience
7. **EA-676: Multi-Format File Support** - Expands system capabilities
8. **EA-677: Error Handling and User Feedback** - Improves system reliability

## Development Sequence

### Sprint 1 (Foundation - 18 Story Points)
- EA-675: Data Persistence Layer (5 pts)
- EA-670: Document Upload Interface (8 pts) 
- EA-676: Multi-Format File Support (3 pts)
- EA-677: Error Handling and User Feedback (5 pts) - Start implementation

### Sprint 2 (Core Processing - 21 Story Points)
- EA-671: OCR Processing Pipeline (13 pts)
- EA-672: Document Classification System (8 pts)

### Sprint 3 (Enhancement & UI - 13 Story Points)  
- EA-673: Document Summarization Engine (8 pts)
- EA-674: Results Display Interface (5 pts)

## Technical Architecture Summary

### AWS Services Used
- **Frontend:** React.js application
- **API:** AWS API Gateway with Lambda functions
- **Storage:** Amazon S3 (documents), DynamoDB (results)
- **Processing:** Amazon Textract (OCR), Amazon Bedrock (AI)
- **Monitoring:** CloudWatch Logs and Metrics

### Lambda Functions
1. `upload-handler` - Document upload processing
2. `ocr-processor` - Text extraction with Textract
3. `classification-processor` - Document categorization
4. `summarization-processor` - Content summarization  
5. `results-handler` - Results retrieval

### Data Flow
```
Upload → S3 → OCR → Classification → Summarization → Results Display
   ↓       ↓      ↓         ↓            ↓              ↓
DynamoDB ← DynamoDB ← DynamoDB ← DynamoDB ← DynamoDB ← DynamoDB
```

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage

All stories include comprehensive acceptance criteria covering:
- **Functional Requirements:** Core feature behavior
- **Technical Requirements:** AWS service integration
- **Error Handling:** Failure scenarios and recovery
- **Data Persistence:** Storage and retrieval patterns
- **User Experience:** Interface and feedback mechanisms

## Estimation Rationale

**Total Story Points:** 55

- **Simple Stories (3-5 pts):** Basic CRUD operations, UI components
- **Medium Stories (8 pts):** AI service integration, complex business logic  
- **Complex Stories (13 pts):** Multi-service orchestration, advanced processing

## Success Metrics

1. **Functional Completeness:** All 8 stories delivered with acceptance criteria met
2. **Performance:** Document processing under 30 seconds end-to-end
3. **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime with comprehensive error handling
4. **User Experience:** Intuitive interface with clear status indicators
5. **Scalability:** Support for concurrent document processing

## Risk Mitigation

1. **AWS Service Limits:** Monitor and request increases as needed
2. **Processing Timeouts:** Implement retry logic and status tracking
3. **Cost Management:** Set up billing alerts and optimize resource usage
4. **Data Security:** Implement encryption and access controls
5. **Integration Complexity:** Thorough testing of service interactions
