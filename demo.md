# Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) Application - Demo Results

## Overview
Successfully built and deployed a complete AWS Intelligent Document Processing solution with:
- **Backend**: CDK infrastructure with Lambda functions, S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway
- **Frontend**: React application with file upload and results display
- **AI Services**: Amazon Textract for OCR, Amazon Bedrock for classification and summarization

## Architecture Components

### Infrastructure (CDK)
- **S3 Bucket**: `idp-documents-102620251713` for document storage
- **DynamoDB Table**: `idp-processing-results-102620251713` for metadata and results
- **Lambda Functions**: 5 functions for upload, OCR, classification, summarization, and results
- **API Gateway**: REST API with CORS enabled
- **IAM Roles**: Proper permissions for all services

### Processing Pipeline
1. **Upload**: User uploads document via React frontend
2. **OCR**: Amazon Textract extracts text and key-value pairs
3. **Classification**: Amazon Bedrock classifies into predefined categories
4. **Summarization**: Amazon Bedrock generates concise summaries
5. **Results**: All results stored in DynamoDB and displayed in frontend

## Test Results
